QeCode is a quantified constraint satisfaction problems (QCSP) solver based on Gecode. 
It can also solve QCSP+, an extension of QCSP where quantifiers can be restricted and QCOP+, a quantified optimizaion problem formalism which scopes multi-level programming problems. 

QeCode have been developped at Universite d'Orleans by Jeremie Vautard, Arnaud Lallouet and Marco Benedetti. More info is available on
