/**
 * \brief %Example: %Grocery puzzle
 *
 * A kid goes into a grocery store and buys four items. The cashier
 * charges $7.11, the kid pays and is about to leave when the cashier
 * calls the kid back, and says ''Hold on, I multiplied the four items
 * instead of adding them; I'll try again; Hah, with adding them the
 * price still comes to $7.11''. What were the prices of the four items?
 *
 * The model is taken from: Christian Schulte, Gert Smolka, Finite Domain
