/**
 * \brief %Example: Locating warehouses
 *
 * A company needs to construct warehouses to supply stores with
 * goods. Each warehouse possibly to be constructed has a certain
 * capacity defining how many stores it can supply. Constructing a
 * warehouse incurs a fixed cost. Costs for transportation from
 * warehouses to stores depend on the locations of warehouses and
 * stores.
 *
 * Determine which warehouses should be constructed and which
 * warehouse should supply which store such that overall cost
 * (transportation cost plus construction cost) is smallest.
 *
 * Taken from:
 *   Pascal Van Hentenryck, The OPL Optmization Programming Language,
 *   The MIT Press, 1999.
 *
 * See also problem 34 at http://www.csplib.org/.
 *
 * Note that "Modeling and Programming with Gecode" uses this example
 * as a case study.
